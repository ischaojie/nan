# Nan
The Nan language is another stupid program language, 
it's means hard in Chinese.

So, what's special about it? 
It's reverse keywords all is Chinese pinyin style,
for example variable declarations in Nan like this:

```
bian a, b = 1
```

So, have fun!

## Example

```
hanShu ()
``` 

## reverse keywords
